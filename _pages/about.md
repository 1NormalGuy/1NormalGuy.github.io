Hi there 👋👋 !

My name is Boheng Li (李勃衡), I'm currently a junior undergraduate student at the [School of Cyber Science and Engineering (SCSE)](http://cse.whu.edu.cn/index.htm), [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://www.whu.edu.cn/), pursuing a B.E. degree in Information Security. I graduated from [Chengdu Foreign Languages School (CFLS)](http://www.cfls.net.cn/), where I spent 1 year learning Olympic in Informatics (OI).

My research interest lies in Artificial Intelligence (AI) Security & Privacy, where I explore the weakness of Deep Learning models in their lifecycles (e.g., Adversarial Attack, Backdoor Attack) and their countermeasures. I also made efforts on turning these weaknesses into good use, applying on privacy protection and Intellectual Property (IP) protection of deep learning models. It's a fortune to be supervised by Prof. [Run Wang](http://wangrun.github.io/) during my study on AI. During my undergraduate study, I also enjoyed a great time conducting research on  Geoinformatics and Remote Sensing, in which I collaborated with my teammates [Jiahao Zhou](https://github.com/DDAKUN) and [Sixing Lin](https://github.com/LSX-s-Software) under the supervision of Prof. [Qingxiang Meng](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/mengqingxiang/zh_CN/index.htm), Prof. [Xiaoliang Meng](http://jszy.whu.edu.cn/mengxiaoliang), and Prof. [Linqing Liu](https://ems.whu.edu.cn/info/1726/10806.htm).

I have won the First Class Scholarship of WHU 2 times (5% school-wide), the HUANG Zhangren Scholarship (60 candidates per year in WHU), the National Scholarship (0.2% national-wide), and was selected the Pacemaker to Merit Student of WHU (60 candidates per year in WHU).

🌟🌟 I'm currently actively seeking for Ph.D., Research Assistant, or internship positions related to Information Security or AI. If you're interested in working with me, don't hesitate to drop me an email. My curriculum vitae will be available soon.
